# Take home exercise

## Technichcal choices

I use ReactJS to implement this challenge, the source code struct boost up with `create-react-app` library.

When this challenge have 4 screens and walk through step by step, I decided use context to build up each screen. The context will provide 4 steps equivalent with 4 screens.
